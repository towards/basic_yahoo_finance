This is a simple Ruby gem to query the Yahoo! Finance API.

Most of the available gems available on rubygems.org for this purpose are either not maintained anymore or simply do not working due to outdated API code. The goal of this gem is to be as basic as possible, hence the name, and to "simply" work. It would be typcially used to get information such as ask/bid price, close price, volume, for one or more stocks by using its symbol. The data is returned raw directly from the API as JSON output.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'basic_yahoo_finance'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install basic_yahoo_finance

## Usage

Instantiate the `Query` class and use the quotes method on it with either a single stock as a `String` and a single module as a `String` or by passing an `Array` of stocks such as show in the two examples below.

```ruby
# Query a stock, with the price module

query = BasicYahooFinance::Query.new
data = query.quotes('AVEM')

# Query multiple stocks

query = BasicYahooFinance::Query.new
data = query.quotes(['AVDV', 'AVUV'])

```

This will return a `Hash` of the stock information available under its symbol name as key in the `Hash`. For example:

```ruby
# Get stock's actual price as a formatted string

data['AVEM']['regularMarketPrice']['fmt']
# "52.72"

# OR the raw value
data["AVEM"]["regularMarketPrice"]["raw"]
# 52.72
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

MiniTest is used as test framework and can be run using:

    $ rake test

As linter RuboCop is used and can be run using:

    $ rake rubocop

This gem is being developed with Ruby 3.3 but should be downward compatible with at least all supported versions of Ruby.
